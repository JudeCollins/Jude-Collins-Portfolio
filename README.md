# Jude-Collins-Portfolio
Homework for week 2 GT bootcamp.
 Mainly use of html and css to create an average portfolio page. With practice this portfolio will be updated!
Title- Jude Collins full stack developer.
This will be my portfolio for interviews in the future. This webpage displays the skills I have gained while in this course as well as my own personal research.

This site is ready to have projects added!!
